# Hotel Price Recommendation
## Introduction
The objective for this project is to recommend optimal pricing in order to maximize profit for a local hotel owner. I was fortunate enough to be able to partner with a local ML startup for this project, and the foundational data used for the exercise was real historical data from one of their clients - a local hotel owner. In order preserve privacy, the real prices have been transformed and the data provided does not contain any identifiable attributes.
